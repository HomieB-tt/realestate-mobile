## Important architectural note: two different backends, on purpose

The mobile app talks to **two different servers**, matching the spec:

- **Supabase directly** — for Auth only (`core/network/supabase_client.dart`). Sign-up/sign-in/session management goes straight to Supabase, same as the architecture doc specifies ("Client apps authenticate via Supabase Auth").
- **The custom backend** (`core/network/api_client.dart`) — for every property/viewing operation. Every outgoing request auto-attaches `Authorization: Bearer <supabase-jwt>`, which the backend's middleware independently re-verifies against Supabase's JWKS. The mobile app never talks to Supabase's own REST API for property/viewing data — it always goes through the custom backend, so business rules (ownership checks, publish rules, ACID booking) are enforced in one place.

## Running it

```bash
cd mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon-key> \
  --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8080/api/v1
```

`API_BASE_URL` defaults to `10.0.2.2` (Android emulator's alias for the host machine's `localhost`). For iOS simulator, use `http://localhost:8080/api/v1` instead. For a physical device, use your machine's LAN IP.


## Auth flow implemented

Email OTP (per architecture spec) — `LoginScreen` sends a one-time code to the user's email via `AuthRepository.sendOtp()`, then verifies it via `verifyOtp()`. `signInWithPassword()` is also implemented on the repository in case you want a password-based flow for agent/admin accounts later, just not wired into the UI yet.

## What's implemented vs. stubbed

**Implemented:** auth (OTP), property search (radius-based, matches the live `/properties/search` endpoint), property detail, create-draft + publish flow (repository/provider level — no "create listing" form screen yet), book-a-viewing flow with the 409 slot-conflict surfaced as a distinct, user-friendly message (not a generic error).

**Not yet built:** image upload to Supabase Storage, a "create/edit listing" form screen for agents, "my listings" / "my bookings" screens (providers exist — `myPropertiesProvider`, `myViewingsProvider` — just no screen consuming them yet), device geolocation (search currently defaults to a fixed demo coordinate).
